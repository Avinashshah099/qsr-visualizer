### PGCR (Policy Gradient for Contextual Recommendations) Model

The project here does an analysis on the dataset of RAVDESS speech which is a multimodal distribution providing us the information of actors, emotions, modality, statement and vocal channel. A policy gradient algorithm is run on the factor model obtained from mel frequencies as well as an ICA model obtained from mel frequencies.
